-when a user clicks match they should be allowed to view user profile
-for the block btn
    -when clicked check if blocked file exists
    -if not then create the file and folder
    -store the location in a db entry for details eg /blocked/carol/blocked.txt
    -add the entry in the format victor = yes
-for the unblock btn
    -change the entry in the format victor = no
-for the chat sessions
    -if carol blocked victor then they shouldn't be able to chat or view profile
