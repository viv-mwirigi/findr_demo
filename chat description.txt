the chat table should function in a number of ways
1. It should store the location of the chat sessions for the current user
   in a folder that has the users specific username
2. it should have an entry with a unique username (primary key) and unique chatting with 
   username(primary key) this key can have multiple entries for whom its chatting with e.g
   user id(1) - assigned username(victor) (pk)
              - chatting with - alex (pk)
              - location for their chat eg (/chats/victor/alex/chats.txt)
   user id(1) - assigned username(victor)(pk)
              - chatting with - megan(pk)
              - location for their chat eg (/chats/victor/megan/chats.txt)


    my username - their username - my storage for our mutual chats(/chats/victor/alex/chats.txt)
    their username - my username - their storage for our mutual chats(/chats/alex/victor/chats.txt)

    the above chats must be the same with only slight differences such as sender and recipient
    if I(victor) send the chat in my chat file(/chats/victor/alex/chats.txt) it should be something
    like
        victor(sender): hi
        alex(recipient): hey
    in the recipients chat file(/chats/alex/victor/chats.txt) it should be
        victor(recipient): hi
        alex(sender): hey

3. you should have 2 insert and 2 select queries
4. ensure that when you insert new entries that it doesn't overwrite the chat.txt file so most
    likely you'd use update, only use insert if there doesn't exist a session different file to 
    update the chats


- on loading the chat session with a certain user
    -check if entry exists in db
    - if it exists then skip insert and move to select the records
        -read each line and return to screen
    - if it doesn't exist then create entry
        -before executing the sql query make sure to do the following
            -create the chats file for me (initially it should be empty)
                - format is 
                     victor(sender): hi
                     alex(recipient): hey
            -create the chats file for recipient (initially it should be empty)
                - format is
                     victor(recipient): hi
                     alex(sender): hey
            -create the chats folder for the sender(me)(victor)
                - format is (/chats/victor(me)/alex(recipient)/chats.txt)
            -create the chats folder for the recipient(alex)
                - format is (/chats/alex(recipient)/victor(me)/chats.txt)
        -insert the entry into the table
